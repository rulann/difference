difference between <article> & <p>

<article>: grouping of content.
           is useful for marking up content that makes sense on its own and could be reused in different contexts.

<p>: is specifically designed for defining paragraphs. It represents a block of text and is commonly used to structure and separate textual content into distinct paragraphs.
     it is more granular and represents smaller units of text within a larger section.
     
Unlike the <article> tag, the <p> tag doesn't say, "I'm a complete and standalone piece."
Instead, it says, "I'm part of the bigger story or section."
So, when you use <p> tags, you're telling the browser that these paragraphs go together, and they're just part of the overall content flow.

The choice depends on the level of independence and reusability of the content you are representing.

difference between <div> & <section>

Both the <section> and <div> elements in HTML are used for grouping and structuring content,

<section>: introduced in HTML5, represents a thematic grouping of content with a heading.
           It is intended for organizing content into meaningful sections, where each section has its own heading and could potentially be treated as a standalone unit.

<div>: is a generic container that doesn't carry any specific semantic meaning.
       It is a block-level container that is often used for grouping and styling purposes.
       Does not have any specific provisions for including a heading.
       Does not imply that the grouped content is a standalone unit.
